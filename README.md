# Zot Showers

Zot Showers is an interactive app to keep the CS people off the streets.
To improve the health and wellbeing of CS nerd losers and their loved ones, it is important to maintain basic sanitation. Unfortunately, this can be hard for some. We understand this, so we created Zot Showers. 

## Running Zot Showers

2. Add flutter to PATH.
3. Execute **flutter run**

## Zot Showers Inspiration
With countless projects and endless deadlines, CS students everywhere struggle to maintain eat, sleep, and even shower. During crunch time, we all know the struggle of taking care of oneself. Introducing Zot Showers. Zot Showers promotes a healthy and safe population by reminding hardworking and busy students to take daily showers. Our app makes it fun and easy with a virtual Peter the Anteater that they must keep clean by logging their showers. In turn, we help prevent the spread of infections, funguses, and diseases.
